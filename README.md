# MainWP check plugins vulnerability extension
Extension for MainWP Dashboard. Check the installed website plugins for vulnerability use the WordFence vulnerability data feed api. You don't need to have WF plugin installed on your website! This is a manual check and only runs when you do a scan from MainWP Dashboard. It will check all child sites and all plugins, so also inactive plugins on child sites.

This MainWP extension can be used to manual check on vulnerabilties for plugins without using the WordFence plugin on your child sites. The current version uses only the last 2 year of records from the WordFence Intelligence API (production) data feed (https://www.wordfence.com/intelligence-documentation/v2-accessing-and-consuming-the-vulnerability-data-feed/).

Make sure you do a full sync of all child site data before scanning your plugins.

This plugin is still under development and new functions will be added in time.

## To Do list
- add option to choose 'production' or 'scanner' feed
- add direct link to update the vulnerable plugin
- exclude theme data from adapted feed

## Feedback
Let me know if you need some function or something appears not to be working correct.
