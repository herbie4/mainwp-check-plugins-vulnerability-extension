# mainwp check plugins vulnerability extension
 Extension for MainWP Dashboard. Check the installed website plugins for vulnerability use the WordFence vulnerability data feed api.

This MainWP extension can be used to check on vulnerabilties for plugins without using the WordFence plugin on your child sites. The current version uses only the last 2 year of records from the WordFence Intelligence API (production) data feed (https://www.wordfence.com/intelligence-documentation/v2-accessing-and-consuming-the-vulnerability-data-feed/).

Make sure you do a full sync of all child site data before scanning your plugins.

This plugin is still under development and new functions will be added in time.
